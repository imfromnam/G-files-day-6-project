# 📁 File Tools – Phone-Friendly Python Script

A beginner-friendly, emoji-powered Python script that lets you:
- ✅ Check if a file or folder exists
- 📖 Read from a file
- ✍️ Write or overwrite a file
- 🖨️ Copy a file
- 📦 Move a file
- ☠️ Delete files or folders

Built entirely on a phone using **Pydroid 3** by **Geraldo Dieterle**.

## 📌 What you need
- Python (any version that supports `os` and `shutil`)
- Works perfectly on **Pydroid 3** for Android

## 💡 How to use
1. Run the script
2. Follow the inputs (it guides you step-by-step)
3. See your files get moved, copied, written, or deleted

## ⚠️ Warnings
- This tool does not confirm before deleting files or folders
- Make sure you enter correct paths (especially on mobile)
